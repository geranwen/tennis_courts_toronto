# Tennis courts within the City of Toronto

The public website provided by the city can be hard to use, since it did not provide the full address and did not show the locations on any map. 

On the other hand, the map-view did not provide enough details about the courts, making the selection process difficult. 

The 2 reasons listed above prompted me into making this simple project where you can best evaluate your options based on various filters, such as number of courts, availability of lights, public vs club courts, accessibility during winter, etc. 

### Next steps:

1. ~~At the moment, the filters need to be implemented in code. The intention in the future is to create a simple GUI for ease of use, hosted on a simple website. This will be the main objective for the next phase of this project.~~
2. ~~Fix csv database to improve accuracy.~~
3. Improved search feature that allows fuzzy matching with tolarence for skipped workds, and possibly return top 3 matches
4. Implement filter by conditions (winter, lights, public/club, etc.)
5. Overlay public transportation options & bike share stations :: not straight forward, which is why it will be given lower priority. 
6. Show public vs private in different color-ed pins on map.
